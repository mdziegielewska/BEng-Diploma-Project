## Examples of the use of Artificial Intelligence in psychology

### Introduction

This Python project implements a chatbot named "Mood Tracker" designed to collect user mood data and generate insightful visualizations. Users interact with the chatbot to provide daily mood updates, and the collected data is used to create two types of graphs:

* **Linear Graph:** Visualizes changes in well-being over the past 31 days.
* **Column Graph:** Compares the frequency of different emotional states within a quarter.


### Project Structure

- **Folders**
  - appData: Stores user mood data collected by the application.
  - appImages: Contains graphical assets used within the app's interface.
  - chatbotModel: Stores the trained model data used by the chatbot.
- **Python Scripts**
  - _appCharts.py_: Generates and displays insightful visualizations based on user data.
  - _appChat.py_: Implements the core logic for chatbot interaction and mood collection.
  - _appRoot.py_: Serves as the main entry point for the application.
  - _appSettings.py_: Manages configuration options for the application.
  - _chatbotConversation.py_: Handles the flow and structure of user conversations with the chatbot.
  - _chatbotTrain.py_: Responsible for training and improving the chatbot model.
  - _dataFunctions.py_: Contains functions for efficient data manipulation and management.
  - _dataSecurity.py_: Ensures security and privacy measures for user data.
  - _dataSupport.py_: Provides auxiliary functions for various data-related tasks.


### Future Work

- Expand the chatbot's conversational abilities.
- Incorporate machine learning for sentiment analysis.
